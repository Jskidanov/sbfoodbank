            <i>Ally’s main purpose is existing as a tool for revealing and locating resource centers in Santa Barbara.
            Ally focuses primarily on food distribution locations, but more resource centers can be found on the “Find Other Resources” page.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Outlined below are the names and functions off <b>all</b> the buttons in Ally. Navigating back to the home page from any of these below
            only requires finding and clicking the “Home” button at the <b>bottom</b> of each page.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li> <b>Find Food</b> - This page is designed to help you find food distribution locations for others quickly. For example, if you encounter
                 a person on the street who does not know the area or looks like they need help, this page will be a helpful image to show them. It
                  is comforting to see so many places in this area that are willing to help and are here for that person. Just showing them these
                  availabilities and resources will help. Feel free to copy the address into a navigation app to show them how to get there.
              </li> <p></p>

              <li> <b>Find Other Resources</b> - On this page you will find food resources and other resource dispensaries. This list will be updated
                regularly by the Food Bank, so there is always relevant information there. Most importantly, this page contains imperative data
                like hours of operating, and addresses. Use this page to rely data to someone in need.
              </li> <p></p>

              <li> <b> Call North County or South County FoodBank </b> - When pressed, this button will immediately dial the North or South County
                FoodBank (depending on which button is pressed). This is especially useful when helping someone that you do not have an answer
                 for. Another useful aspect of calling the FoodBank is establishing a connection and relationship between the FoodBank someone
                 in need of help, especially if the person in need of help does not have a cell phone.
              </li> <p></p>

              <li> <b> Donate to the FoodBank </b> - This button will take you directly to the donation page on the Santa Barbara FoodBank website.
                Donating money to the FoodBank is one of the greatest ways to help if you’re not in direct contact with homeless people. We
                encourage and commend donations to the FoodBank and verify that their use of money is responsible and effective. Give today!
              </li> <p></p>

              <li> <b> Feedback </b> - This button will take you to a Feedback form page. We’d love to hear from you. Any suggestions and comments
                from your experience as a user are welcome.
              </li>
            </ol>
